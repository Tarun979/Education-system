<h2><font size="5" color="green">What are the challenges?</font></h2><hr>

<font color="yellow"><p><big>Grinding poverty and illiteracy</big>. Hunger. Limited job opportunities. Lack of access to health care, good sanitation and clean water… and more.<br> A studyCitation of poverty in Kolkata’s slums showed households with children suffered significantly higher levels of deprivation than those without children, putting children at particular risk

<h2><font size="5" color="green">What is Global Care doing to fight child poverty in India?</font></h2><hr>

<p>Helping children access education in India is by far the most effective way of reducing poverty., so education is at the heart of our work in India, as elsewhere.<br>

The Pavement Club was established to give slum children the chance of schooling – and healthy meals too. It’s informal, but it works. Initially, classes were delivered quite literally on the pavement with just a handful of children, but now the Pavement Club operates from our partners’ Ripon Street headquarters and the Vijayan Pavamani Centre at Creek Row. Today there are over 350 children receiving a good standard of education from 25 teachers.

The children learn reading, writing and maths, health and hygiene. They enjoy songs and stories, dancing, drama and art. They have a wash and breakfast on arrival, and lunch before they go home.<br>
